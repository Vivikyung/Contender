Inspiration
I was inspired by the simplicity of Down to Lunch, which is an app that my friends and I use to communicate eating/hanging out times with the click of a button.

What it does
The app allows people to send data like how many steps they've taken, how many miles they've run, how much they benched, etc. to friends with the simple push of a button. Their friends will then receive the notification and have the option of logging their stats side by side, creating a list view of people and their achievements. This will create a friendly competition between friends to exercise more, and hopefully in the future the competition choices will expand to include eating healthy, good habits, etc.

How I built it
I used android studio in order to complete this mobile app.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I've never published a hack before and I've never demoed before, so this was a first for both.

What I learned
I learned how to use Android Studio!

What's next for Contender
Hopefully, the choice of competitions will increase, users will be able to sort friends into categories in case they want to compete with a certain group of people with a certain thing, and users can customize their own competitions.
